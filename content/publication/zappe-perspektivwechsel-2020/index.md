abstract: Since 2015, migration and immigration have been relevant topics of political
  debate in Germany. Therefore, various communication studies researched the media
  reporting on these issues and examined how it affects the perception of migrants
  within the German population (e.g. Arlt &amp; Wolling, 2017). In distinction to
  this, the present study addresses the question of how migrants themselves receive
  migration reporting, how they perceive it, and how it shapes their personal migration
  and integration actions. We conducted two focus group discussions with migrants
  from Sub-Saharan Africa. The participants discussed both the reception and evaluation
  of migration reporting in their country of origin and in Germany. The results show
  that the topic of migration was hardly reported in the countries of origin, which
  is why personal migration decisions were more influenced by interpersonal communication.
  In Germany, the African participants perceive media reports about migration issues
  as too one-sided and as reduced to the sub-themes of poverty and war.
