abstract: mHealth apps are growing in popularity among smartphone users. Such apps
  often contain social features that enable users to compare their behavior with others
  but to function, mHealth apps require users to share health information which is
  considered a threat to individuals’ privacy. Building on social comparison theory
  and research on privacy decision-making, we investigate the effects of users’ social
  comparison orientation and privacy attitudes as well as the potential mediating
  effect of health information disclosure on users’ intention to use a dietary app.
  Relying on a PLS-based structural-equation model in a sample of N = 528 participants,
  our study supports claims of a positive effect of social comparison orientation
  on intention to use a mHealth app. Further, the negative effect of privacy attitude
  and the positive mediation of information disclosure were supported as well. The
  study also demonstrated that findings were stable when the context of information
  disclosure is changed.
