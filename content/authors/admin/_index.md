Jakob Henke is a PhD Student at the Department of Journalism at TU Dortmund University. His thesis is about the cognitive processes of news selection, that is, how do individuals select which news stories to engange with and what drives these decisions. He has also published and given talks on media trust and credibility and (mobile) privacy. 

He teaches classes on statistics and data analysis as well as communication research methods, such as content analysis, surveys, and experiments.
